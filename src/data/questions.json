    "question": "In packet switching, why is there no queuing delay if two or fewer users transmit at the same time?",
    "options": [
      "Because the users use different frequencies.",
      "Because the sum of their transmission rates (2 Mbps) does not exceed the link capacity (2 Mbps).",

      "Because of high propagation speeds."
    ],
    "correct_indices": [1],
    "explanation": "Queuing delay occurs when arrival rate is greater than output rate. If only 2 users are active, the arrival rate (2 Mbps) is equal to the link capacity (2 Mbps), meaning packets are sent as fast as they arrive."

    ],
